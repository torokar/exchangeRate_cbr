  "\n    curl - transfer a URL",
  "\nSYNOPSIS",
  "\n    curl [options / URLs]",
  "\nDESCRIPTION",
  "\n    curl is a tool for  transferring data from or  to a server using URLs.  It",
  "    supports these protocols:  DICT, FILE, FTP,  FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS,  HTTP,",
  "    HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS,  LDAP, LDAPS,  MQTT, POP3, POP3S,  RTMP, RTMPS,  RTSP,",
  "    SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.",
  "\n    curl  is  powered  by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See",
  "    libcurl(3) for details.",
  "\nURL",
  "\n    The URL syntax is protocol-dependent.  You find a detailed description  in",
  "    RFC 3986.",
  "\n    If you provide a  URL without a  leading protocol:// scheme, curl  guesses",
  "    what protocol you want. It then defaults to HTTP but assumes  others based",
  "    on often-used hostname prefixes. For example, for hostnames starting  with",
  "    \"ftp.\" curl assumes you want FTP.",
  "\n    You can specify any amount of  URLs on the command line. They are  fetched",
  "    in a sequential manner in  the specified order unless you use  --parallel.",
  "    You can specify command  line options and URLs mixed  and in any order  on",
  "    the command line.",
  "\n    curl attempts to reuse connections when doing multiple transfers, so  that",
  "    getting many files from the same  server do not use multiple connects  and",
  "    setup handshakes. This improves speed.  Connection reuse can only be  done",
  "    for URLs  specified for a  single command  line invocation  and cannot  be",
  "    performed between separate curl runs.",
  "\n    Provide an IPv6 zone id in  the URL with an escaped percentage sign.  Like",
  "    in",
  "\n\t\"http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/\"",
  "\n    Everything provided on the command line that is not a command  line option",
  "    or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as such.",
  "\nGLOBBING",
  "\n    You can specify  multiple URLs or  parts of URLs  by writing lists  within",
  "    braces or ranges within brackets. We call this \"globbing\".",
  "\n    Provide a list with three different names like this:",
  "\n\t\"http://site.{one,two,three}.com\"",
  "\n    Do sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:",
  "\n\t\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt\"",
  "\n    With leading zeroes:",
  "\n\t\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt\"",
  "\n    With letters through the alphabet:",
  "\n\t\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\"",
  "\n    Nested sequences are not supported, but  you can use several ones next  to",
  "    each other:",
  "\n\t\"http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\"",
  "\n    You can specify a step counter for  the ranges to get every Nth number  or",
  "    letter:",
  "\n\t\"http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt\"",
  "\n\t\"http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt\"",
  "\n    When using []  or {} sequences  when invoked from  a command line  prompt,",
  "    you probably have to  put the full URL within  double quotes to avoid  the",
  "    shell from  interfering  with it.  This  also goes  for  other  characters",
  "    treated special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.",
  "\n    Switch off globbing with --globoff.",
  "\nVARIABLES",
  "\n    curl supports command line variables (added in 8.3.0). Set variables  with",
  "    --variable name=content  or  --variable  name@file (where  \"file\"  can  be",
  "    stdin if set to a single dash (-)).",
  "\n    Variable contents can  be expanded in  option parameters using  \"{{name}}\"",
  "    if the option name  is prefixed with  \"--expand-\". This gets the  contents",
  "    of the variable \"name\" inserted, or a blank if the name does not  exist as",
  "    a variable. Insert  \"{{\" verbatim  in the  string by prefixing  it with  a",
  "    backslash, like \"\\{{\".",
  "\n    You an access and  expand environment variables  by first importing  them.",
  "    You can select  to either require  the environment variable  to be set  or",
  "    you can  provide a default  value in  case it  is not  already set.  Plain",
  "    --variable %name  imports the  variable called  'name' but  exits with  an",
  "    error if  that  environment variable  is not  already  set. To  provide  a",
  "    default  value  if  it  is  not  set,  use  --variable   %name=content  or",
  "    --variable %name@content.",
  "\n    Example. Get the USER environment variable  into the URL, fail if USER  is",
  "    not set:",
  "\n\t--variable '%USER'",
  "\t--expand-url = \"https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method\"",
  "\n    When expanding variables, curl supports  a set of functions that can  make",
  "    the variable  contents more convenient  to use.  It can  trim leading  and",
  "    trailing white space  with \"trim\", it  can output the  contents as a  JSON",
  "    quoted string  with \"json\", URL  encode the  string with  \"url\" or  base64",
  "    encode it  with \"b64\". To  apply functions  to a  variable expansion,  add",
  "    them colon separated to the  right side of the variable. Variable  content",
  "    holding null bytes that are not encoded when expanded cause error.",
  "\n    Example: get the contents of  a file called $HOME/.secret into a  variable",
  "    called \"fix\". Make sure  that the content  is trimmed and  percent-encoded",
  "    when sent as POST data:",
  "\n\t--variable %HOME",
  "\t--expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret",
  "\t--expand-data \"{{fix:trim:url}}\"",
  "\thttps://example.com/",
  "\n    Command line variables and expansions were added in 8.3.0.",
  "\nOUTPUT",
  "\n    If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It  can be",
  "    instructed to  instead  save  that  data  into a  local  file,  using  the",
  "    --output or  --remote-name options.  If  curl is  given multiple  URLs  to",
  "    transfer on  the command  line, it  similarly needs  multiple options  for",
  "    where to save them.",
  "\n    curl does  not parse  or otherwise  \"understand\" the  content  it gets  or",
  "    writes as  output. It  does  no encoding  or decoding,  unless  explicitly",
  "    asked to with dedicated command line options.",
  "\nPROTOCOLS",
  "\n    curl supports  numerous protocols,  or  put in  URL terms:  schemes.  Your",
  "    particular build may not support them all.",
  "\n    DICT",
  "\n\tLets you lookup words using online dictionaries.",
  "\n    FILE",
  "\n\tRead or write  local files.  curl does not  support accessing  file://",
  "\tURL remotely, but when running  on Microsoft Windows using the  native",
  "\tUNC approach works.",

  "\tlevers. With or without using TLS.",
  "\n    GOPHER(S)",
  "\n\tRetrieve files.",
  "\n    HTTP(S)",
  "\n\tcurl supports HTTP with numerous options and variations. It can  speak",
  "\tHTTP version 0.9,  1.0, 1.1, 2  and 3 depending  on build options  and",
  "\tthe correct command line options.",
  "\n    IMAP(S)",
  "\n\tUsing the mail  reading protocol,  curl can download  emails for  you.",
  "\tWith or without using TLS.",
  "\n    LDAP(S)",
  "\n\tcurl can do directory lookups for you, with or without TLS.",
  "\n    MQTT",
  "\n\tcurl supports MQTT version 3.  Downloading over MQTT equals  subscribe",
  "\tto a topic  while uploading/posting  equals publish on  a topic.  MQTT",
  "\tover TLS is not supported (yet).",
  "\n    POP3(S)",
  "\n\tDownloading from a pop3 server  means getting a mail. With or  without",
  "\tusing TLS.",
  "\n    RTMP(S)",
  "\n\tThe Realtime Messaging Protocol is  primarily used to serve  streaming",
  "\tmedia and curl can download it.",

  "\n\tcurl supports SSH version 2 scp transfers.",
  "\n    SFTP",
  "\n\tcurl supports SFTP (draft 5) done over SSH version 2.",

  "\twhat it reads on stdin and outputs what the server sends it.",
  "\n    TFTP",
  "\n\tcurl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.",
  "\nPROGRESS METER",
  "\n    curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating  the",
  "    amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time left,  etc.",
  "    The progress meter  displays the transfer  rate in  bytes per second.  The",
  "    suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024  bytes. 1M",
  "    is 1048576 bytes.",
  "\n    curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you  invoke curl",
  "    to do an  operation and  it is  about to write  data to  the terminal,  it",
  "    disables the  progress meter  as otherwise  it would  mess  up the  output",
  "    mixing progress meter and response data.",
  "\n    If you want a progress  meter for HTTP POST  or PUT requests, you need  to",
  "    redirect  the response  output  to  a  file,  using  shell  redirect  (>),",
  "    --output or similar.",
  "\n    This does not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit  out any",
  "    response data to the terminal.",
  "\n    If you prefer a progress bar instead of the regular  meter, --progress-bar",
  "    is your friend. You  can also disable  the progress meter completely  with",
  "    the --silent option.",
  "\nVERSION",
  "\n    This man page describes  curl 8.8.0. If you  use a later version,  chances",
  "    are this  man page  does not  fully document  it. If  you  use an  earlier",
  "    version, this document  tries to include  version information about  which",
  "    specific version that introduced changes.",
  "\n    You can always learn which the latest curl version is by running",
  "\n\tcurl https://curl.se/info",
  "\n    The  online version  of  this  man  page  is  always  showing  the  latest",
  "    incarnation: https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html",
  "\nOPTIONS",
  "\n    Options start  with one  or two  dashes. Many  of the  options require  an",
  "    additional value next  to them.  If provided  text does not  start with  a",
  "    dash, it is presumed to be and treated as a URL.",
  "\n    The short \"single-dash\" form of the  options, -d for example, may be  used",
  "    with or without a space  between it and its  value, although a space is  a",
  "    recommended separator.  The long  double-dash  form, --data  for  example,",
  "    requires a space between it and its value.",
  "\n    Short version options that do not  need any additional values can be  used",
  "    immediately next to each other, like  for example you can specify all  the",
  "    options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.",
  "\n    In general, all boolean  options are enabled  with --option and yet  again",
  "    disabled with  --no-option. That  is, you  use the  same  option name  but",
  "    prefix it with \"no-\". However, in  this list we mostly only list and  show",
  "    the --option version of them.",
  "\n    When --next is used, it resets  the parser state and you start again  with",
  "    a clean  option state,  except for  the options  that  are global.  Global",
  "    options retain their values and meaning even after --next.",
  "\n    The   following    options    are   global:    --fail-early,    --libcurl,",
